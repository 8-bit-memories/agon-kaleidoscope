This is a simple kaleidoscope for the Agon Light series of retro computers.

It is derived from code written for the TRS-80 Model I in the 1980s.
The Model I used a Z-80 clocked at 1.77 Mhz.
Its textual screen resolution was 64x16 characters. The drawing characters
allowed it to "plot" 128x48 points. It did not have bitmap graphics.

The Agon does have bitmap graphics, at up to 1024x768.
Its eZ80 processor runs at 18 MHz.
Its graphics coprocessor, the VDP, has substantial acceleration capability.

The BBC BASIC version of this kaleidoscope runs as fast at 1024x768 as the assembler
version did on the TRS-80 at 128x48.

The eZ80 assembler version is only a little faster, and is about the same size assembled
as the tokenized BBC BASIC version.
